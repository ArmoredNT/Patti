For our controller, we made a custom controller for Patapon on the psp. As it's a rhythm game, I thought a music instrument as a controller would be fun, and the limited amount of inputs made it perfect for something like bongos. So we took inspiration from the Donkey Kong Country controller and made something with two drums that lit up an LED and played a noise when hit with force. The controller made use of two force sensors, which were hooked up to analogue pins to detect the hit. When a hit was registered, power was sent to the corresponding light and piezo speaker, and an input would be sent to unity. Force sensors were used to try and mimic real action of hitting a bongo. Speakers and lights were also added to provide some extra feedback to the player. 

Zachary created the controller, Eugene made the Unity project, and we did the write-up together.
